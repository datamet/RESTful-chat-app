## How to run

**Server:**

Development mode:
- Runs on port `5000` (or port assigned by environment variable `PORT`)
- Prints debug messages to the console
- Restarts the server whenever a project file is saved
- Uses an in-memory store for easier testing

To run the server in development mode:
```
cd server
npm i
npm run dev
```

<br>

Production mode:
- Runs on port `8080` (or port assigned by environment variable `PORT`)
- Does not print debug messages
- Uses a persistant file system storage option

To run server in production mode:
```
cd server
npm i
npm run start
```

*NB:* Make sure you are using the LTS version of node: `v14.16.0`.
